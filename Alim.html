Some things I do outside of school is play sports, video games and serve in my community. In the future, I would like to work for the Chicago Bears. Tbh I am a bum but its okay because I accepted how bad I am at Overwatch compared to my dear friend Shayan Saleem. He is a god at widow. But, yeah this is my blog that I won't be really using.

The only way to do this is when two of the miners encounter the same blocks at the same time which causes the delay in cryptocurrency. Â  -->
